# airbnbpython
A breakdown of airbnb data to determine if the 2015 regulations effected prices and the number of hosts using python, pandas, and the jupyter notebook format.

Unfortunately the data used is much too big to upload, however I uploaded a pdf of the work so you dont have to access the data to see the visualizations.
